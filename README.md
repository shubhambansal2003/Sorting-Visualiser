# Sorting Visualizer

Visualization of different sorting algorithms in C++ with SDL2 Library.

This project visualizes various sorting algorithms, including Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort, using the SDL2 library in C++. It handles a fixed list of 130 elements, allowing users to randomize the list and select an algorithm to observe. Although the visualized sorting times do not exactly match the algorithms' true time complexities, delays are introduced for faster algorithms like Merge Sort to enhance visualization clarity.
# Controls:-

WARNING: Giving repetitive commands may cause latency and the visualizer may behave unexpectedly. Please give a new command only after the current command's execution is done.

Available Controls inside Sorting Visualizer:-
- Use 0 to Generate a different randomized list.
- Use 1 to start Selection Sort Algorithm.
- Use 2 to start Insertion Sort Algorithm.
- Use 3 to start Bubble Sort Algorithm.
- Use 4 to start Merge Sort Algorithm.
- Use 5 to start Quick Sort Algorithm.
- Use 6 to start Heap Sort Algorithm.
- Use q to exit out of Sorting Visualizer
