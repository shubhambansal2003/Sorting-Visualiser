# Sorting-Visualiser
This project visualizes various sorting algorithms, including Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort, using the SDL2 library in C++. It handles a fixed list of 130 elements, allowing users to randomize the list and select an algorithm to observe. Although the visualized sorting times do not exactly match the algorithms' true time complexities, delays are introduced for faster algorithms like Merge Sort to enhance visualization clarity.
